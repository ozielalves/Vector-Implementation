# TAD-Vector. A project for Estrutura de Dados Básica I (EDB I)

## Description
Repo for a entire class and template implementation of Vector library. Done as asked by my professor at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte([UFRN](www.ufrn.br)).


## How to compile
To compile we will use a makefile, so all compilations be more dynamic and automatic.
```bash
# To compile the whole project, insert 'make':
$ make

# To compile only the objects and see if class implementations were compiled well, insert 'make build':
$ make build

# To clean up all remaining trahsh data and files, such as the binary ones, insert 'make clean':
$ make clean
```

## How to execute
